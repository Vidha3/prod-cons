# prod-cons
A simple demonstration of the working of producer - consumer. 
DataBuffer - holds the buffer array list. The object of DataBuffer is modified when producer/consumer is called. 
MyProd - the producer implementation. Adds data to the buffer object until the buffer is full 
MyCons - the consumer implementation. Removes data from the buffer until buffer is empty
